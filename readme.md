# SED - "stress enhanced diffusion" code prototype

In this project, we are developing a code prototype to model the [stress enhanced diffusion](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3530738) phenomena occuring in lithium batteries. Our ultimate goal is to understand the coupling between the diffusion of charged ions and the elastomechanic properties of the active material in the electrode. To that end, we develop a simple prototype code to model these effects in one dimension, possibly also extending the analysis to two dimensions and unstructured meshes. 

The code is based on ```python``` programming language relying on ```numba``` library whenever increased performance is needed. For pedagogical purposes, we first start with the purely diffusive case with no coupling to elastomechanics, in order to get acquainted with FDM and FVM methods (finite difference and finite volume methods, respectively) for solving the underlying partial differential equations. Then, to also consider the coupling to elastomechanics, we apply the FEM (finite element method) approach. The main goal of all this is to become acquainted with the procedures before implementing them in the actual three-dimensional model in the production code.
