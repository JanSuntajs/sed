    "# 1D difussion equation solver implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we provide a pedagogical implementation of the 1D diffusion equation solver via the finite volume method. We will use our reasoning below to eventually devise the final prototype code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general equation to solve is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\left(\\Gamma \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right) + S_\\phi; \\hspace{5mm} \\phi = \\phi(x, t), \\, \\Gamma = \\Gamma(x, t).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In the inner term on the right-hand-side, we recognise the flux term, $J = -\\Gamma \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}$ with $Gamma$ being the corresponding transport coefficient while $S_\\phi$ denote the source terms. To solve the above equation, we first discretize the interval $[x_0, x_0 + L]$ into $N$ equal\n",
    "parts $x_{i, i+1}$ of length $\\Delta x = L/N$. To apply the [finite volume method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method), take into account the conservation laws (the continuity equation) present in our problem by integrating the original equation over the volume of each subinterval. After making use of the divergence theorem, we obtain:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\overline{\\phi_i}}{\\partial t} \\Delta x = J(e_i) - J(w_i) + \\overline{S_i}\\Delta x.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is nothing more than a continuity equation for the $i$-th subinterval, stating that the rate of change of $\\overline{\\phi_i}$ (averaged over a given interval) is proportional to the difference of fluxes passing through the interval boundaries along with the possible contributions of the source/drain terms (again, the overline denotes averaging over the chosen subinterval). The numerical details now enter through the appropriate choice of the discretization scheme used to represent the fluxes along with the choice of a given time propagator to advance the solutions in time. We also need to take care of the boundary and initial conditions, which we will do below as we go through the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: as standard in the literature, we used $J(w_i)$ and $J_(e_i)$ do denote the fluxes at the western (left) and eastern (right) cell boundary, respectivelly. It is important to remember that in the FVM, the values of the discretized quantities on the grid refer to the cell center values, while the fluxes (and corresponding transport coefficients) are evaluated at the cell faces. This, particularly in higher dimensions, importantly distinguishes FMV from the finite difference method (FDM). The most important difference already evident in 1D pertains to the treatment of boundary conditions. "
